        "Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, i.e., a class. It also restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which means that the internal representation of an object is hidden from the outside. This is often achieved using access modifiers (like `private` or `protected` in some languages). In Python, encapsulation is conventionally done using single (`_`) or double (`__`) underscores to denote 'private' or 'protected' attributes/methods, though these are merely conventions and don't strictly enforce privacy.\n",
