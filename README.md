# Development-of-Interactive-Cyber-Threat-Visualization-Dashboard

The proposed project, *Development of an Interactive Cyber Threat Visualization Dashboard*, aims to design and implement a real-time, data-driven platform that provides cybersecurity analysts with a clear and intuitive view of the evolving threat landscape. Modern organizations face an overwhelming volume of security alerts and vulnerability information, making it difficult to quickly identify critical risks and emerging attack patterns. This project addresses that challenge by consolidating multiple streams of cyber threat intelligence into a unified, interactive visual environment.

The system focuses on continuously gathering live threat data from publicly available sources such as vulnerability feeds and malicious IP intelligence. This data is processed and enriched to provide meaningful context, including geographical origin, severity indicators, and standardized threat classifications. By transforming raw security data into structured and visually interpretable information, the platform enables faster situational awareness and more informed decision-making.

A key objective of the project is to present complex cybersecurity information through dynamic visualizations such as geospatial risk maps, temporal trend graphs, and hierarchical threat breakdowns. These visual components allow users to quickly identify hotspots of malicious activity, observe fluctuations in attack frequency over time, and understand which vulnerability categories or attack techniques are most prevalent. In addition, the system incorporates analytical capabilities to highlight unusual patterns or sudden surges in threat activity, supporting proactive risk management.

The final outcome is a responsive web-based dashboard that delivers near real-time updates and executive-ready insights into the organizational threat posture. By combining live data ingestion, intelligent processing, and interactive visualization, the project demonstrates how advanced data science and cybersecurity concepts can be integrated into a practical monitoring solution. Overall, the work contributes toward improving threat visibility, prioritization, and rapid response in modern security environments.
